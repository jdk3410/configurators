 Scripts to generate config files
 
 asaconfig4.py: 
 In a previous role, I provisonined Cisco ASA firewalls. Lots of them. So to save myself time, I wrote a script in python that would take a few variables as input, and then generate the entire configuration which could be pasted into the unit. It also prints out a nice cat.
 This was mostly written in 2014 and only the only recent changes I have made would be to convert it to Python 3, so most likely the configurations would not work on Modern Cisco firewalls.

 asaconfig4.c:
 Same thing as above but written in C. Think of it like a lite version of the python script.

 asaconfig4.go:
 Same thing as above but written in Go <not done>
